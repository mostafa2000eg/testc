# This is a placeholder for the app icon
# In a real project, you would need a proper .ico file
# You can create one using online tools or image editors

# For now, this file serves as a reference
# The actual icon should be a 32x32 or 64x64 pixel ICO file
# representing a gas meter or customer service theme
